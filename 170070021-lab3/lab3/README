1,2,3,4 are codes and 5,6,7,8 are respective compiled programmes. All results and observations in Report.pdf

For compilation
Thread Ordering : gcc -pthread -o order Ordering.c  
Barrier synchronization: gcc -pthread -o barrier Barrier.c
Priority synchronization: ggcc -pthread -o prior Priority11.c
Subset Number of Threads Execution: gcc -pthread -o subset Subset_Thread.c

For Running the compiled programmes:
Thread Ordering : ./order
Barrier synchronization: ./barrier
Priority synchronization: ./prior
Subset Number of Threads Execution: ./subset
